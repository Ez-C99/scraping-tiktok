One of my jobs is to make sure Lahaina/Maui is never forgotten - and to bring moments of joy, comfort and smiles as much as I can. The struggle and rebuild of Lahaina/Maui continues, BUT the resilience, strength & PRIDE of our people and culture remains steadfast and inspiring. This is who we are as Kanaka Maoli. Who we are as Polynesians. We protect. We love. We show up. People will always make noise, but in the end, we saw very few come back to make positive things happen. To those that did, we love you and mahalo. Love U back #Maui & #Lahaina - stay strong and I’ll see you soon. #cheehoo #808",1744650708,295000,10500,664,88

7487701629119171886,"If you’re lucky enough to reach the highest of mountain tops - in anything you do - you begin to ask yourself, “what’s next?”  I had a good, sobering “come to Jesus” talk with myself back in Jan of 2020 when we all got rocked by COVID and then my dad suddenly died, and I heard his spirit whisper,  “the show must go on”  I realized it was time to get back to work, and create new mountains, and bring everyone along - because despite being #1 on ANY call sheet, success is NEVER singular. EVERYONE plays a critical part.  I’m honored to my core to stand alongside my fellow men and women of color in Apple Films new two-part doc “#1 On The Call Sheet”. Your artistic talents are breathtaking, your drive is inspiring and cheers to creating new mountains ⛰️  ~ dj  #1OnTheCallSheet  Streaming NOW on @Apple TV ",1743366431,560400,33300,3585,620

THANK YOU to all of you - our Mana Ohana - for “loving the liquid” as they say.  Back to work, brick by brick 🧱    Cheers 🥃   ~dj",1743090325,2600000,153500,5683,5513
